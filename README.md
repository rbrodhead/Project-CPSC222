# This project covers the process of cleaning, combining and analyzing 3 data sets (checking account data, sleep data and weather data) using statistical methods (t-testing, basic stats), and machine learning (kNN and Decision Tree Classification) in order to search for correlations between sleep, spending and the weather.  I used machine learning to try to predict what factors lead to poor sleep (sleep less than the median across my sleep data set, which was 7 hours).  
# The project is divided up into 4 sections, an introduction, data analysis, machine learning and a conclusion
# Some functions are included in the file "utils.py", and the data files we will use are "checking-cleaned.csv", "spokane_daily_weather_cleaned.csv", and "sleep.csv"
# In order to run this, please make sure that all of these files are located in the same directory as "project.ipynb"
